For boards that enumerate as `BOOTLOADER` [see our blog to determine if an update for the DAPLink bootloader is available.](https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/DAPLink-bootloader-update/)
      3. In a terminal execute
         - `cp <path to firmware file> <MAINTENANCE> && sync`
         - Note: make sure to change `MAINTENANCE` to the name of the mount point of the drive on your system.
      4. Power cycle the board. It will now enumerate and mount as `DAPLINK` or the name of the board.
